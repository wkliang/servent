Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged Changes

If the git status command is too vague for you —
you want to know exactly what you changed, not just which files were changed —
you can use the git diff command.

We’ll cover git diff in more detail later;
but you’ll probably use it most often to answer these two questions:

	What have you changed but not yet staged?
	And what have you staged that you are about to commit?

Although git status answers those questions very generally,
git diff shows you the exact lines added and removed — the patch, as it were.

[note]

git needs you to know what working status is exactly and
what to do for next step.

It’s important to note that git diff by itself doesn’t show all changes made
since your last commit — only changes that are still unstaged.

This can be confusing, because if you’ve staged all of your changes,
git diff will give you no output.

to integrate with iaxclient_lib and to use it as crossplatform library.
there are some parts needed to be enhanced for original SHTTPD codebase.
